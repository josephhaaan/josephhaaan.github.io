### About Myself                

Kawa Hui (Junhui "Joseph" Han), a striver who constantly breaks through himself in studies and practice, has left a deep impression on the campus and social stages with his persistent pursuit of excellence. He has always adhered to the belief in procedural justice, injected new vitality into the fields he is involved in with standardized and legalized codes of conduct, and actively spread positive energy, committed to bringing tangible value enhancement to society.​                                  

During his academic career, Han graduated from Shanghai Commercial Accounting School and the School of Economics and Management of Shanghai Donghai College successively. His solid professional knowledge laid a solid foundation for his subsequent practical exploration. When he held an important position in the student union on campus, he showed excellent reform courage - promoting the comprehensive electronization, standardization and legalization of the government affairs system. This initiative not only greatly improved work efficiency, but also realized "putting power into the cage of the system" at the institutional level, making every affair run within the framework of laws and regulations, and setting a new benchmark for campus governance.​                                      

Han's vision has never been limited to the campus. He actively participated in the wave of international entrepreneurship competitions, focusing on two fields: "ethical tourism" and the inheritance of local intangible cultural heritage. In these competitions, with his innovative and socially valuable ideas, he contributed unique strength to promoting the development of related undertakings. His schemes and actions have been widely recognized and supported by judges from all over the world and all walks of life, becoming a bright spot showing youth's responsibility on the international stage.​                              

Adhering to procedural justice is the core principle of Han's actions. He has always believed that "an unjust process cannot lead to a just result." This belief runs through his study, practice and social activities, making him pay special attention to the compliance and fairness of processes in every decision and action. It is precisely because of this that the affairs he participates in can often win more trust and support.​                                               

In the professional field, Han also performed outstandingly. He participated in many presentations related to economy and trade. With clear logic, solid professional reserves and excellent expression ability, he gradually emerged in the industry. After graduating from campus and entering society, the name "Han" quickly became a landmark presence on the lecture stages in Shanghai and even internationally. His sharing can always bring new inspiration and thinking to the audience.

In addition to shining in the professional field, Han is more keen on public welfare undertakings. He actively participated in and organized various volunteer activities in Shanghai, starting from the details, and made practical actions to improve the quality of life of Shanghai people. Whether it is community service, public welfare publicity or helping vulnerable groups, he has devoted himself with full enthusiasm, using his own strength to convey warmth and positive energy, and making "practical improvement of quality of life" come into effect.​                                               

Han's growth track is a history of struggle guided by faith and based on practical work. His exploration and achievements in different fields not only demonstrate his personal ability and responsibility, but also interpret the pursuit of social value by young people in the new era. And all this is just the prelude to his life journey.                             

Moreover, he is also the President of the Tiancaiba Club. This is an excellent group composed of virtuous and talented people recognized by Han, and the name is derived from the Chinese word "Tiancai" (genius).
